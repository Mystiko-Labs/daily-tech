The aim of this repo is to practice and solve the questions sent by the DailyTech Series. 
So that we can keep ourselves up to date on competitive programming.

##getting-started

 - Create your own branch from `master`
 - Take some time to think and solve the problem daily or as per your pace.
 - Upload the solution. Format should be:
    * The implementation idea above code in comments
    * The code of the solution
    * test-cases(mostly corner cases)
    * output
